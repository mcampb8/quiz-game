For this project, I created a quiz game about one of my favorite hobbies: sports. To create this quiz, I utilized my newly acquired knowledge/skills in Javascript while applying previously learned materials in CSS and HTML.

I was able to set a timer, display several questions, check for the correct answer, and calculate a user's score. I did run out of time on this assignment unfortunately. I commented in/commented out some of the things that I was working on and would like to implement to make it perfect if I did have more time.

I did receive some help on this assignment from a TA and a tutor in order to parse through the array of objects as well as work out some CSS kinks.
